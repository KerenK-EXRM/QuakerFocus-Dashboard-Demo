So yeah, you know, you're going down that busy street like you guys should definitely be you know off towards the front of the road or you know, the lane that's to the right of you, you know. If the left lane is empty and you can definitely see that on the opposing Lane left side. It's empty at the time that he's accelerating forward in the very beginning. You know, there's nothing there's no car for him to be worried about, you know, move around or anything like that. So it's just like, you know, what are you looking at in the beginning? Like what is catching your attention in the beginning? You know, the the truck is definitely moving forward while you're looking off to the left. So, you know, that's this just the main part that kind of stood out to me wage.
